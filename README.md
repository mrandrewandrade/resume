# Github Pages Branch for Andrew Andrade's Résumés

This is the Github pages branch for my resumes.  It includes the LaTex code to generate the resumes, and the html which runs [mrandrewandrade.com/resumes/](http://mrandrewandrade.com/resumes)     

Please see the [master branch](https://github.com/mrandrewandrade/resumes) for the actual resumes pdfs.
